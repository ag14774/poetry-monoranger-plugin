class MonorepoAdderRemover:
    """A class to modify the behavior of Poetry's add and remove commands for monorepo support.

    This class ensures that the add and remove commands are executed in a way that supports
    monorepo setups, including handling the shared lock file and rolling back changes if needed.

    Under normal circumstances, the add/remove commands modify the per-project lockfile, and if it
    was modified successfully, *only then* the pyproject.toml file is updated. This leaves the
    pyproject.toml in a good state in case the lockfile generation/dependency resolution fails.

    However, in a monorepo setup, we want to maintain a single lockfile for all the projects in the
    monorepo. This means that the add/remove commands should not generate a per-project lockfile.The
    purpose of the DummyInstaller is to disable the installation part of the add/remove commands
    and just allow the add/remove to directly modify the pyproject.toml file without generating a
    per-project lockfile.

    After the pyproject.toml file is modified, we can update the root lockfile by creating a new
    Installer and executing the steps that are normally executed by the add/remove command. Since
    with this approach the pyproject.toml file is modified before lockfile updating, we need to
    ensure that the changes are rolled back in case of an error during the lockfile update.
